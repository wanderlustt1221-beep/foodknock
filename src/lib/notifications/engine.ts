// Business code never imports a provider directly. It either:
//   1. emits an event via `notificationEvents` / `notificationEngine.emit(...)`, or
//   2. calls `notificationEngine.send(channels, target, payload)` directly
//      when it already has a fully-built payload (e.g. the cron campaign
//      route, which already knows the slot).
//
// Adding Email/WhatsApp/FCM later = write a provider implementing
// DeliveryProvider, register it below. No business code changes.

 * site does — each pre-existing event keeps exactly the channel(s) it was
 * written against. Events with no entry here fall back to "every
 * registered provider" (the original Phase 1 behavior), which is correct
 * for genuinely channel-agnostic events like push.campaign / admin.broadcast.
